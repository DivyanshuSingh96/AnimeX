#  AnimeX - Anime Recommendation Search Engine

## Problem Statement
The world isn’t perfect. But it’s there for us, doing the best it can… that’s what makes Anime so beautiful. We all find it difficult to actually identify the charcters or series to which it belongs.


## Solution
So here we are with the Anime Recommendation Search Engine using the Image Processing Feature.
Our ML Model will display all the information of that Particular  Character's Anime and also display similar types of Anime recommendation.


A better idea of  using  image processing feature makes it unique as well as makes it easier for the user to search their anime and it's surroundings.
We usually see recommendation engines for Movies and Books but you wouldn't find recommendation engines based on Image Processing Features.
